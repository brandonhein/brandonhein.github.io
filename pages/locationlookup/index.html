    <h5>Location Lookup API</h5>
    <p>
        I wanted to take some public data and expose it via an API. Leveraging AWS Lambda and AWS API Gateway, I achieved a Serverless Application 
        that will spin up and use resources when invoked, as well as provide data related to a zip code. Data like longitude, latitude, county fips, etc.
        Using Lambda and the API gateway, you only pay for the resources you use.
    </p>
    <p>
        This API handles multiple zip codes in a request (batching), they are delimited by ','. Example: 49783,90210,85001.  That helps applications
        that leverage this data to make one call out to this API and not a couple dozen times for one zip code.  The API comes with an 'IsAwake' field,
        that calculates if a location is eligible to be called. This extremely helpful for applications that need to know a zip code is eligible to be called 
        given specific state requirements on telemarking calling.
